# MLND - Capstone Project
Capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## Problem Statement
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network is used to estimate the texture index of aggregates. As input, the model uses images, while the output is the texture index obtained using the Aggregate Image Measurement System (AIMS) equipment.

## Dataset
The images and respective texture indexes were provided by the Department of Transport Engineering (DET) of the Federal University of Ceara (UFC).
The DataPreparation.ipynb notebook contains the code responsible for preparing the data in the right format to be run in the other notebooks.
